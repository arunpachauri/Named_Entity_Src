# flask_example - NER Application
A very simple example and tutorial on Flask which shows how to do 3 things:-

1. Accepting input from user
2. Do something with the user input (for ex, call a python function on this input)
3. Pass the output of the python function to another HTML as a variable and present the user back with this new HTML.
